## HTML5 Canvas Testing

This is an un-React-ified version of the Canvas manipulation done by [thermalmodel.com](https://thermalmodel.com)
in order to build an intuition around how it is performed.

Experiment with it by cloning this repository, then running:
```
cd <path-to-cloned-repo>
cd canvas_testing
npm i
npm start
```

This will start a server the live-reloads on edit+save. Click a directory to view the canvas for it.
