# Hot Stuff

TODO:
- [x] Fix bug with dropdowns [5]
- [x] Change shift functionality to command/control (multi select, click and drag) [4]
- [x] Node color is temp [5]
- [x] Add the ability to change the plot/canvas/table size by dragging the borders [5]
- [x] Fix bug with runtime/timesteps not resetting [5]
- [x] More reasonable sig figs in plots (10th of degree) [5]
- [x] Theory explanation section/popup [5]
- [x] Differentiate between conduction and convection just for user tracking. Remove unidirectional option from app. No source/target terminology. [5]
- [x] Deal with math for radiative heat transfer (incomplete/wrong right now?) [5]
- [x] Limits on resizing panels [5]
- [x] Plot margin a percentage of domain rather than fixed val [5]
- [x] Multiple connection types per A <--> B connection (allow all combos except conduction + convection together) [5]
- [x] Clarify radiation resistance formula in theory [5]
- [ ] Figure out why control-click not working on windows [5]
- [ ] Limit num points and/or compress appState to not hit limits on localStorage [5]
- [ ] Optional notes field for nodes/connections in table.
- [ ] Logo + favicon [5]
- [ ] Fun default model (models?) [5]
- [ ] Sane validation on editing each editable cell in table [5]
- [ ] Tutorial popup instead of tutorial model [5]
- [ ] Resistance calculator [4]
  - [ ] Link to engineers edge website
  - [ ] Calculator pops up while editing
- [ ] Make node active when editing in table [4]
- [ ] Escape while editing cell exits and resets default val [4]
- [ ] Enter while editing cell exits same as tab [4]
- [ ] Ability to add text blobs on canvas - would be cool [3]
  - [ ] Gives you a place to annotate e.g. "natural convection"
- [ ] Decide to allow or not non-zero power generation for boundary nodes. Confirm it shouldn't matter. [3]
- [ ] Add info to canvas: [3]
  - Power gen for each node
  - Resistance between nodes?
  - Heat transfer between nodes?
- [ ] Make errors more visible than just in console [3]
- [ ] Ability to swap source/target in connection table (depends on keeping unidirectional or not) [3]
- [ ] Copy/paste all selected [3]
- [ ] Horizontal/vertical snap functionality for creating grid [2]
- [ ] Orders of magnitude on convection coefficients [2]
  - [ ] If you don't have test data to back it up, you start with order of magnitude
- [ ] File export/import (falsdat doesn't have this) [2]
- [x] Reset all stored state button (with confirmation) - not important if not the tutorial [1]
