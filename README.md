This repository contains the source code for [theleo.zone/thermal-model](https://theleo.zone/thermal-model/).

Engineers often use models to answer electromechanical design questions about heat transfer and temperature. [theleo.zone/thermal-model](https://theleo.zone/thermal-model/)
aims to fill the gap between [back-of-the-envelope-calculations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-of-the-envelope_calculation)
and complex, expensive tools like [Ansys](https://www.ansys.com/).

The tool will stay free, open source, ad-free, tracking-free, and MIT-licensed. Model format will remain backward compatible as new features are introduced.

Core model math is encompassed in the [hotstuff-network](https://github.com/robinovitch61/hotstuff/tree/main/packages/hotstuff-network) package
and can be used in any javascript environment. Usage examples in the [README](https://github.com/robinovitch61/hotstuff/tree/main/packages/hotstuff-network#usage).
